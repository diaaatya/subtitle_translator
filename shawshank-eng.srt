1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,084
If I Didn't Care

2
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:26,342
If I didn't care

3
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:31,848
More than words can say

4
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:37,103
If I didn't care

5
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:42,317
Would I feel this way?

6
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:47,531
If this isn't love

7
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:53,162
Then why do I thrill?

8
00:00:54,581 --> 00:01:00,336
And what makes my head
go round and round

9
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,215
While my heart stands still?

10
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,928
If I didn't care

11
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:13,849
Would it be the same?

12
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:21,607
Would my every prayer begin and end

13
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,610
With just your name?

14
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:29,490
And would I be sure

15
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:35,454
That this is love beyond compare?

16
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:39,166
Would all this be true

17
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:45,674
If I didn't care for you?

18
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:05,694
Mr. Dufresne,

19
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:10,031
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

20
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:16,788
It was very bitter.

21
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:21,292
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

22
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:26,256
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

23
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,174
What was your response?

24
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,218
I told her I would not grant one.

25
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:33,346
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

26
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:37,100
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne,
according to your neighbors.

27
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:41,897
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

28
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:46,527
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

29
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:48,529
She packed a bag.

30
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:52,783
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

31
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:55,161
Glenn Quentin.

32
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:57,329
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

33
00:02:57,414 --> 00:03:01,292
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

34
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,420
Did you follow her?

35
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,840
I went to a few bars first.

36
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:10,801
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

37
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:14,472
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

38
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:16,140
and waited.

39
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:18,434
With what intention?

40
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:20,311
I'm not sure.
